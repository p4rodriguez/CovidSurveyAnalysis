# Analysis of Covid Data

This repo contains R scripts for some covid data analysis using the FB/CMU survey data with covidtracking.com data

These scripts were used to produce some exploratory analysis suggestions for the data challenge
## Start

Start with the seromod..R script,  read the comments there.
You can source that script, and the Imod..R script,
but the I4data script you need to cut&paste the sections you want to run, 

This also uses the excess deaths CDC data.  All analysis are at the state level
