# Analysis of Covid Data

This repo contains R scripts for some covid data analysis using the FB/CMU survey data with covidtracking.com data

These scripts were used to produce some exploratory analysis suggestions for the data challenge
## Start

Start with the seromod..R script,  read the comments there.
You can source that script, and the Imod..R script,
but the I4data script you need to cut&paste the sections you want to run, 

The main data set is the 'overall-state.csv' file from FB/CMU survey data, which is not included here
All analysis are at the state level.

The analysis also uses the excess deaths CDC data, included here.
The seroprevalence and state data are here, and publicly available.
These scripts read in the oxford government response index, the 'stringency index' was explored but not used in any analysis
(The csv file is not here but can be found at https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).  In the future I would remove that code.
